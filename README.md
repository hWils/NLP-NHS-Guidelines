# NLP-NHS-Guidelines

This code is used to improve guidelines for administering IV medication for nurses in the NHS. This is to reduce mistakes that can occur, sometimes resulting in fatalities, due to badly written guidelines. This uses GPT via OpenAI.

The guideline is first divided into sections based on headers such as 'Administration', 'Compatability with Other Medicines', and text from each section is extracted. Dealing with each section individually provids more control over the output. The writing based improvements occur in three stages.
1. A summarised verson of the text is output- focusing on brevity
2. A refined version of the text which makes more subtle tweaks to the text based on feedback from nurses in user-studies.
3. The markdown of the text is improved.
